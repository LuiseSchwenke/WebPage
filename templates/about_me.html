<h2 style="text-align:center">  MY LIFE IN SHORT</h2>
<p style="align:justify; font-size: 18px;">I am Luise Schwenke and 25 years old. <br>
In 2022 I graduated in Food Engineering at University of Applied Sciences Neubrandenburg/ Germany.<br>
My biggest interest has always been in the areas of genetics, molecular biology and scientific research.
Therefore, I started working in different clinical and analytical research laboratories next to my
bachelors. Because most of the workflows are getting heavily automated by robots and
software, I discovered my interest in computer science and development. In my jobs I always
liked to help automate and facilitate work flows mainly with Excel and calculate the companiesâ€™
stocks of resources.<br>
Since the area of IT fascinates me so much and I felt so inspired and excited developing codes,
I finally decided to take a professional approach to it. By now I took different courses with focus
on Web Development and Data Science using Python. In the area of Data Science, I am
building projects to analyze and visualize dataframes, for example with Pandas and Matplotlib
and train prediction models for estimations with Scikit-Lean and XGBoost. I am able to retrieve
the data using APIs and evaluate it by sentiment analysis. In the backend part of Web
Development, I work with SQL/ SQLite and Table Relationships, Flask for user interactions,
Jinja2 and APIs. Especially while deploying Websites, I leaned how to work with Version Control and Git.
    <p> On my GitHub I share projects, that I yet created:
    <a href="https://github.com/LuiseSchwenke"></a> https://github.com/LuiseSchwenke</p>
 <br>I am currently taking courses to learn working with PowerBI and AWS Cloud Service
Development and deepening my knowledge on working with neural networks.<br>
Privately I like to spend my time with my horse and enjoy the nature.<br>
During an exchange semester in brazil through my bachelors, I discovered my love for surfing,
which I do, whenever it is possible. Unfortunately, Berlin and whole Germany, my place of living,
cannot offer an ocean with surfable waves, so I travel to the beaches, whenever I can.<br>
Besides that, I enjoy to read books, especially about psychology and sciences or code some handy
    applications. </p>
